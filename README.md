# Calculator made with C and raylib/raygui

This is the first time I have tried making an app with C.
I used raylib and raygui for the interface.
If you would like to build it just clone into it,
then --- if you need raylib --- download it, 
then see this website to see how to build it with your os: https://deepwiki.com/raysan5/raygui/2-getting-started
for me it was <gcc main.c -o main -lraylib -lGL -lm -lpthread -ldl -lrt -lX11> 
Not sure if that is correct but it works! Have Fun :)
